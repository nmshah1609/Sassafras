# STAT 440 Module 2 - The Unfittables

> This module is on simulated data. Simulated the Sassafras dataset: an X â†’ Y mapping. The Sassafras consists of 203,287 data items, of which 153,287 are provided in the Sassafras training set, and 50,000 are provided in the Sassafras testing set. Each data item consists of 75 covariates divided into 9 groups (columns of X) and one target (Y). The Sassafras dataset contains missing data indicated using the string NaN or the string ?. The Sassafras dataset has no meaning: you can think of it as a puzzle or a work of art.
